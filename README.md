# Doom Server Wizard

This python3 wizard was done in order to create DooM servers easily, with a very few knowledge needed. 
It currently works on Windows and partially on Linux.

Currently, this tool supports:
- PrBoom+
- DOOM DOS & Chocolate Doom

Zdaemon is currently on the works.

Zandronum, and Odamex are planned in a near future.<br />

# Usage:
> python3 doomsv-wizard.py
After that, it'll ask you the Doom gameport you'd wish to make a server, with its settings.

Once it is done, you'll get a file with the settings you asked. Start it, let your friends connect and have fun!

# Currently Missing

## Global
> There is no PWAD splitting or filename verification. (Also, no warning for Linux users)
No commandline checks.

## PRBoom/PrBoom+
> There's not the client connect batch/bash.
